"I love parking enforcement!!", said no one ever.

Simply seeing those mini, paragonic, slow-cruising vehicles stalk up and down the streets of San Francisco for prey is enough to induce a small amount of anxiety. 

It's a necessary job for sure, but maybe I'd like to know exactly when one of those silent, seemingly ubiquitious vehicles has arrived right in front of *my* car.
